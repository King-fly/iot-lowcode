# Low-Code Solution for IoT Applications

This project is a Low-Code solution focusing on IoT applications, designed to help developers quickly build IoT applications. The project is currently under development, but we are actively working on it and will release the first version as soon as possible.

## Tech Stack

* Vue.js
* React

## Project Overview

Developing in the IoT field requires a lot of time and effort to build sensor networks, process data flows, and create user interfaces. To help developers complete these tasks more quickly and efficiently, we provide this Low-Code solution.

The core idea of this solution is to use a visual approach to quickly build IoT applications by dragging and dropping components and configuring properties. These components include sensors, data processors, user interfaces, etc., and developers can easily combine them into a complete application through simple drag-and-drop operations.

## How to Use

The project is still under development, but we will soon release the first version. You can use it by:

1. Downloading the latest release from GitHub
2. Installing it using npm

## Contribution

We welcome any form of contribution, including but not limited to code, documentation, issues, etc. If you have any questions or suggestions, please raise them in the Issue, and we will respond promptly.
